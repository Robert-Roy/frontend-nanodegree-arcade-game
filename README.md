===============================

This is a simple game I made using an engine and art assets provided by an online course.

To run this game, download this repo to your system, then execute the index.html file in any modern browser.

You can access a hosted version of the page here: https://robert-roy.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-game/

In order to play, use the arrow keys to navigate past the bugs. Once you get to the river, you have won and you can try again from the beginning.
